# IMMEDIATE FIX for MyBinder Timeout Issue

## Quick Steps to Fix the 300-second timeout:

### Step 1: Replace environment.yml with minimal version
```bash
# Backup current file
mv environment.yml environment-original.yml

# Use minimal environment
mv environment-minimal.yml environment.yml
```

### Step 2: Remove or simplify postBuild
```bash
# Backup current postBuild
mv postBuild postBuild-original

# Create simple postBuild (or remove it entirely)
echo '#!/bin/bash
echo "MyBinder setup complete"
mkdir -p ~/examples
echo "print(\"Hello from MyBinder\")" > ~/examples/test.py
' > postBuild

chmod +x postBuild
```

### Step 3: Remove complex Docker setup
```bash
# Backup Dockerfile
mv Dockerfile Dockerfile-original

# MyBinder will use repo2docker with environment.yml only
```

### Step 4: Commit and test
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix MyBinder timeout - minimal environment"
git push
```

Then try MyBinder again: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Yuvraj198920/eopfzarr-docker-image/HEAD

## What This Does:
- Uses minimal conda environment (fast to build)
- Removes complex Docker build process
- Removes heavy startup scripts
- Gets basic GDAL working quickly

## After It Works:
You can gradually add packages back to environment.yml one by one to find what causes the timeout.

## Test URL:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Yuvraj198920/eopfzarr-docker-image/HEAD

## If Still Failing:
1. Remove postBuild entirely
2. Use even simpler environment.yml with just: python, jupyter
3. Make sure all files are properly committed and pushed
